# stock-market-kafka-data-engineering-project
## Overview:  
This project will build a data pipeline to process real-time stock market data using Kafka. The pipeline will ingest data from a stock market data provider, process it using Python, and publish it to Kafka. Downstream consumers can then subscribe to the Kafka topic and consume the data in real time.

## Architecture:

The data pipeline will consist of the following components:

Data source: The data source will be a stock market data provider that provides real-time data.
Ingest pipeline: The ingest pipeline will be implemented in Python. It will read data from the data source, transform it into a format suitable for Kafka, and publish it to Kafka.
Kafka: Kafka will be used as a distributed streaming platform to store and process the real-time stock market data.
Downstream consumers: Downstream consumers can be any application that needs to consume real-time stock market data, such as a trading application or a data analytics application.

## Technologies:

- Programming Language - Python
- Amazon Web Service (AWS)
1. S3 (Simple Storage Service)
2. Athena
3. Glue Crawler
4. Glue Catalog
5. EC2
- Apache Kafka

## Implementation:

The data pipeline will be implemented using the following steps:

- Create a Kafka cluster: Create a Kafka cluster on AWS using Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK).
- Create a Kafka topic: Create a Kafka topic to store the real-time stock market data.
- Write a Python ingest script: Write a Python script to read data from the data source, transform it into a format suitable for Kafka, and publish it to Kafka.
- Configure the ingest pipeline: Configure the ingest pipeline to run at regular intervals.
- Implement downstream consumers: Implement downstream consumers to consume the real-time stock market data from Kafka.

## Benefits:

This project will provide the following benefits:

- Real-time access to stock market data: Downstream consumers will be able to access stock market data in real time, which is essential for many trading and analytics applications.
- Scalability: The data pipeline can be scaled to handle large volumes of data.
- Fault tolerance: The data pipeline is fault-tolerant, meaning that it can continue to operate even if some components fail.

## Conclusion:

This project will build a comprehensive data engineering pipeline to process real-time stock market data using Kafka. The pipeline will be scalable, fault-tolerant, and provide real-time access to stock market data.
